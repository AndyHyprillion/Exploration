# LIFE: From small To Big
LIFE is an interactive coding artwork that presents the whole procedure of the life of cells. The cells will experience three life stages from birth to division and to death. When the cells are generated at the very beginning, they are excited to see the world while they are fragile as well. Feeding and caring are needed. After they are fed with enough food, they will start their procedure to procreate. Afterward, they will fade away and die once they are starving or old enough. The more the number of cells, the less focus the operator has on each of the cells. The division and death seem invisible to them while their focus cannot be so specific that can observe every single cell. The cells are called for help, but the operator cannot see it unless they open the sketches mode.  The cells here are another form to present the life of our human beings. The life procedure can present our life while the operator is indicated to the power holder. Combined with the COVID background, many people died because of the lack of attention. The artwork not only is an introduction to the life procedure of cells but also is a carrier that contains further thinking about life in the post-epidemic world.
